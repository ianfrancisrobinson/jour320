			<p> 
				In late July of 2012, Angie Epifano sat on a field behind Amherst College and wrote in her journal for about three hours. She had realized that what happened to her more than a year before as a college freshman was something that she “should not and could not forget and could never forgive.” 
			</p>
			<p> 
				Epifano was raped by an acquaintance in her college dormitory on May 25, 2011. That July journal entry about her sexual assault experience and Amherst’s poor response eventually became a published letter in the school’s independent newspaper, The Amherst Student. Epifano’s letter was read by so many people that it crashed the website’s servers and sparked a movement for other sexual assault survivors to speak out.
			</p>
			
			<p> 
				“Survivors are coming out, they’re telling their stories, and people are realizing these people aren’t just one student in a school of 20,000 that I’ll never meet,” Epifano said. “This is the student next to me, this is my best friend, this is my girlfriend or boyfriend. And that personal connection is what’s giving it power, and is what’s making people realize this is a human rights issue.”
			</p>
			<p> 
				Now 21, Epifano withdrew from Amherst and is a public speaker and consultant. She wants to “continue going to schools and educating students about sexual assault and Title IX and their rights.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Sexual assault on college campuses is a very real issue, and its roots are embedded in our society’s acceptance of rape culture. With assistance from survivors like Angie, Title IX, the Clery Act, the Dear Colleague Letter and President Obama’s White House Task Force on Protecting Students from Sexual Assault, survivors are regaining control of their lives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Even with the progress, a society ripe with rape culture will continue to allow sexual assault to happen, and will continue to discourage survivors from speaking up.
			</p>
			<p>
				Steve Adler said he wishes he were out of a job. But as the Prevention Education Specialist for Rape Victim Advocates (RVA), he doesn’t see his job being threatened anytime in the near future.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I think sexual assault is a result of thousands of years of male supremacy and white supremacy, and those systems took thousands of years to set up and they’re probably going to take thousands of years to dismantle,” he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				The not-for-profit organization strives to turn sexual assault victims into survivors by providing non-judgmental counseling in Chicago hospitals and recommending other organizations that can provide legal and medical support.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Rape culture is a culture in which media and cultural norms excuse and endorse sexualized violence and behaviors that are often legally considered rape – such as getting a partner drunk to have sex,” he said.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="violence">
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
				It doesn’t look that different across university campuses, with most college-aged survivors experiencing victim blaming, according to Renee Redd, the director of Northwestern University’s Women’s Center.
			</p>
			<p>
				“We shame women about their bodies, still. We don’t encourage them to celebrate their sexuality,” Redd said. “We blame them more than we do men, because we say that men are sexual beings and they can’t stop themselves.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Our society is set up, she said, to feel safer if we blame the victim, which is usually a woman. Laura Stuart, Northwestern University’s Coordinator of Sexual Health Education and Violence Prevention, explained that alcohol and sexual assault is connected statistically, but in a misleading light. People who are drinking become the targets of perpetrators, but the alcohol itself, is not the cause.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stuart said the dialogue needs to shift away from the victim behavior and onto the perpetrators. The college environment creates an “implied trust” among students, because they are away from their family and friends from home. And perpetrators take advantage of that trust.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Perpetrators rely on the existence of rape culture to get away with what they do,” Stuart said. “Perpetrators really count on the victim-blaming narrative. They really count on survivors feeling shame.”
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="victim">
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
				Most people understand the concept of victim blaming, Stuart explained, but perpetrator behavior has been overlooked until recently. Both Redd and Adler see programming as the next step to try to eradicate this culture. On university campuses, the tricky part is getting students to listen, and with the majority of sexual assaults occurring freshman year, like in Epifano’s case, it’s a talk that needs to happen
			</p>
			<p>
				Adler recommended non-traditional programming for perpetrators, because the threat of prison isn’t going to stop rape.
			</p>
			<p>
				“In my opinion, there needs to be programming marketed towards college men about consent, and about addressing male privilege,” he said. “But there also needs to be a transformative justice approach to discipline perpetrators of sexual assault.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Rape culture allows perpetrators to act without consequence, and discourages survivors from seeking help or justice.
			</p>
			<p>
				“The important thing to realize about culture, is that when you are immersed, you don’t see it, unless you actively try to take a step back and examine what’s going on around you,” Stuart said. “Everyone comes in here, having grown up in rape culture, and needs to unlearn it.”
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Redd, survivors have an “anticipated judgment of not being believed.” Thus, many survivors veer away from any legal action, because of the distrust of the criminal system. Survivors also have to relay their experience innumerable times, a retelling act that can be traumatizing itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Even if it’s a process that ultimately gets the person what they want… even if you achieve that goal, you still have been forced to engage with something that most people just want to forget ever happened,” Stuart explained.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if a survivor chooses not to take legal action, the stigma associated with being sexually assaulted stops many survivors from speaking to anyone about the experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				“A big barrier was the feeling that I had of being very isolated and alone,” Epifano said. “So, I felt like if I came forward, people would think of me as a freak and turn against me, and there would be this backlash for speaking out on something that is seen by a lot of people as taboo, especially since it was going against a prestigious college like Amherst.”
			</p>
			<p>
				What will peers, family members, professors think? Some survivors don’t want to ruin the perpetrator’s high social standing, or their group cohesion, if the offender was a friend. Male survivors may be afraid to speak out because of the assumption that they should always want to have sex.
			</p>
			<p>
				Survivors may avoid certain clubs or opportunities because perpetrators are involved in them. Epifano tried to block the pain of that night by leaving town and then focusing on school and extracurricular activities. When she found herself working on a fundraiser with her perpetrator sophomore year, her act shattered and all of the fear, vulnerability and depression rushed back. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				All of these barriers, among many others, are why 56 percent of sexual assaults go unreported, according to Adler. Especially on university campuses, the result of seeking help is often disheartening, because “universities do not handle these cases well.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Epifano knows that, all too well.
			</p>
			<p>
				As detailed in her letter, Epifano’s sexual assault guidance counselor/Title IX coordinator and dean of students essentially swept her rape under the rug, failing to discipline her attacker and sending Epifano to a psychiatric ward. Following her release from the ward, Amherst barred Epifano from studying abroad, citing her mental state, and discouraged her from going through a disciplinary hearing. When Epifano decided she wanted to withdraw from the school, she was faced with criticism from her dean, who implied that transferring from Amherst would be a step down in her life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Epifano, even after her letter was published, the president of Amherst stated that the school had “gone above and beyond in helping [her] and [she] had just misinterpreted their actions, and that it was quite regrettable that [she] felt the need to withdraw.” 
			</p>
			<p>
				Joining Amherst, Adler listed University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Connecticut and University of Notre Dame as several other notable universities that failed to properly handle Title IX sexual assault cases. 
			</p>
			<p>
				“Sexual assault on college campuses needs to be treated differently,” Adler said. “I feel like universities often use a disciplinary process rather than getting law enforcement from the city involved.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Redd said universities have a moral obligation to protect their students, but they have a legal obligation to protect both parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I think sometimes, we’re in a quandary,” she said. “When we’re talking from a legal perspective, sometimes it can seem to students like there is not much empathy for what they’re going through.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Redd mentioned universities stepping up with the Clery Act, which requires universities to report their crimes, counseling centers, women’s centers, and new policies that help survivors both legally and emotionally. In 2011, the Office of Civil Rights scripted the Dear Colleague Letter, which clarified the responsibilities of universities in dealing with sexual assault cases. Still, universities seem to be lacking.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Title IX is basically all about equal access to education,” Stuart explained. “And survivors leave. Campuses have a responsibility, as much as they can, to provide a safe learning environment.”
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="rep">
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
				In January 2014, The Huffington Post reported that 30 cases of sexual violence were brought to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights because of university and college mishandlings. The complaints received “related to sexual violence and failures to address them under the gender equity law Title IX.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, there are federal complaints against two dozen universities and colleges, and controversy over the handling of sexual assault cases at ten schools, according to the Huffington Post.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Dartmouth College, a rape guide was posted this school year about how to sexually assault a specific student. The student’s full name and dorm of residence was included in the post, and weeks later she was sexually assaulted at a party. The site, BoredatBaker, could only be accessed with a Dartmouth email address, and the school reportedly didn’t block the site from campus wifi, saying they did not have the capabilities to do so. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Epifano said that universities and colleges need to educate their student bodies about rape culture, and draw out an accessible and clear action plan that students should follow if they’re sexually assaulted.
			</p>
			<p>
				“They’re [colleges/universities] just going to continue having all of these anonymous faces go through schools, traumatized, and no one will ever be able to know, and nothing can really be done,” Epifano said. “Colleges and universities really need to look at this as something that they can have an impact on… not just placing a Band-Aid on these sexual assaults and not just brushing it off to the side.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Epifano said that Middlebury College in Vermont, Williams College in Massachusetts, and Bates College in Maine are all making significant progress in handling sexual assault cases. Middlebury brings in a third-party investigator to deal with sexual assault cases, so the school can’t be biased. Both Williams and Bates have “Party with Consent” organizations, where people wear shirts with that label and flash-mob parties to educate students about sexual assault.
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, Epifano thinks the Survivor Movement can really gain some ground in bipartisan politics, and was pleasantly surprised when President Obama created a task force for protecting against sexual assault in January.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I think there is so much momentum right now, it basically needs to be kept in public awareness and there needs to be a concentrated effort to make sure that it doesn’t get stuck in government politics,” Epifano said.  
			</p>
			<p>
				In January 2014, 39 congressmen drafted a letter to the Department of Education, requesting that information regarding sexual assault on college campuses become more transparent.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It’s difficult to maintain transparency, and that’s a goal of part of the Survivor Movement,” Redd said. “It has definitely been student activism over the years – students are very powerful – that has increased the level of resources and attention being paid to these issues.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Stuart said she’s encouraged that students are standing up for an undergraduate survivor on Northwestern’s campus, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by Peter Ludlow, a tenured professor in the school’s philosophy department.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I will say that I’m glad that students are getting engaged and that they care and are speaking out, in what I hope is a productive way,” she said.
			</p>
			<p>
				On a broader scale, Adler said that society needs to “dismantle systems of racism, classism, and sexism if we’re going to stop rape culture.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“[The Survivor Movement is] survivors of sexual assault stepping out of the shadows and into the public eye to say that they are survivors of sexual assault and there is no shame or stigma attached to sexual assault,” Adler said.
			</p>
			<p>
				The question remains, however, will there ever be a way to fully prevent and protect against sexual assault?
			</p>
			<p>
				“It’s super complex and it has a lot to do with who is disenfranchised in society,” Stuart said. “To me, that question is also like, do you ever think we’re going to have a society where everyone is treated equitably?”
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the leaders of the Survivor Movement, Epifano plans to transfer to another university in the fall and focus her efforts on reforming the sexual assault education and prevention on that campus. There is still a long road ahead, and Epifano said that the reason she spoke out was because she realized that there were so many other people with experiences just like hers.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Remember that you’re not alone, and that no matter what happened to you or what people said to you, you didn’t deserve what happened. It wasn’t your fault,” she said. “And eventually, the darkness that comes from being assaulted will begin to fade away and there will be that light.”
